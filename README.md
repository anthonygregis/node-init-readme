#### NPM Init

NPM Init initializes your node project in a directory and asks some starting questions to build your package.json for your project

#### Package.json

This is the brains of your project, it keeps things organized and allows others to easily download your project and install all necessary modules to run this project / server. It also keeps track of current version, project name, description, and author.

#### Import Modules / Packages

To import a module (or package) to your javascript file you can use require() to import the module you installed with npm i or from an exported module in your code.
